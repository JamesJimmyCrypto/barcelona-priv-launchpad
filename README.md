What we built? Babalaunch is basically a launchpad dapp on a local subnet. Babalaunch differs from other launchpads with its permissionless side. The token launches are decentralized with the Liquidity Bootstrapping Pools.

Interface 
The interface of the launchpad stands out with its user friendly display. "Home", "Allocation Staking", and the "Launch" tabs are on the middle top of the page where the user's attention is driven towards first when they enter the website.

- Home tab includes introductory data on the project and also has the "Sales" and "Staking" buttons.

- Allocation Staking tab offers users an easy interaction with the cards "Stake BABUSH" and "Withdraw BABUSH". All the relative info such as "Pool Info", "Staking Info" and "Reward Info" are included in the bottom of the page.

- Launch tab provides detailed info on previous launches and the upcoming launches.

- To the top right of the page is the "Connect Wallet" button. Connect Wallet is a toggle tab where the Coinbase Wallet and Metamask are listed in order.

Covalent API We made use of the Covalent API to track the current price data of the tokens, pull and show historical data.

Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool

The launchpad uses LBPs which makes use of the Weighted Math, a generalization of x*y=k constant product formula recommended for AMMâ€™s by Vitalik Buterin.
LBPs start with high prices. This disincentivizes whales and bots from grabbing up all the liquidty at the get-go. So a fair share is provided.
The starting capital of a team that will launch a token can be small. For a team running an LBP with their token or DAI, 10 to 20 percent DAI is enough with LBPs whereas 50 percent is needed for other platforms. This substantially reduces the starting capital requirements of the team.
